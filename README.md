# Blast-Runner-Source-Code
The project will be a top-down platformer in which the player will control a spaceship using two push down buttons for the controls either going upward or downward dodging objects and particles and scoring points by the amount of time in seconds. The project will have three people playing one for each client of the same game and when both clients of the game are done, the leaderboard system is implemented with 3 4-LED displays one for each player with the fourth arduino.

Overall Description of the System: There will be 3 instances of the game that are being played which are all top-down games with the lives and score being tracked as the game is being played. When each game is over, the score will be sent to the fourth arduino to then take the serial inputs and display them on 3 4-LED displays from highest to the lowest score.
